		<h2><br>
			Why raise my voice? &emsp;<br>

		<ul><li>
			The ultimate aim of the project is to create a corruption less country.
		</li><li>
				The main problem is, many people afraid to raise their voice against the unjust they come accross in their daily life.
		</li><li>
				Raise my voice is the perfect platform for those who wish to file complaints without revealing their identity.
		</li></ul>
        <br><br>
				Everyone one of us would have seen many corruption cases in real-time. Many would have faced directly, but we cannot speak anything at that 
				point because we may be cornered by officials who have something in their hands which is called POWER. We wish that someone could help us.
				Unfortunately, there is no help at that time.<br>
				The Police department has a special force called <b>Anti Corruption Department</b>. If proper complaints were filed with the proper piece of 
				evidence, proper legal actions will be taken on the corrupted person.<br>
				The problem is no one is ready to file complaints and the police department says that without proper complaints they cannot do anything. 
				People are not ready to file complaints because they dont want to face problems with unknowns. This happens because their mind triggers fear 
				based on the movies and TV serials they watch.<br>
				RAISE MY VOICE helps to file complaint without from address if it is a socio-welfare case. We can see many whatsapp forwarded photos and 
				videos of corrupted people. If, People who forward stuffs files the same in oru website then legal action starts the next second.
